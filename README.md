# Farhat's notes

This app was bootstrapped with Shopify CLI, with a boilerplate Hydrogen setup. All unused routes and components were removed, save Aside and PageLayout. My code is in `/app/routes/_index.jsx` and the components in `/app/components/ProductCard***.jsx`. I added the products export csv in the assets directory.

Deployed to Oxygen: https://farhat-domaine-54174b1b090d59a5d5b2.o2.myshopify.dev/

# Hydrogen template: Skeleton

Hydrogen is Shopify’s stack for headless commerce. Hydrogen is designed to dovetail with [Remix](https://remix.run/), Shopify’s full stack web framework. This template contains a **minimal setup** of components, queries and tooling to get started with Hydrogen.
